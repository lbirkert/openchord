# OpenSong

OpenSong is an opensource alternative PWA (progressive web app), which allows importing SongSelect®/CCLI® song sheets and has a builtin patcher for transposing. It is supposed to be a church-specific, lightweight, free and cross platform alternative to the iPad-only, paid OnSong® software.
